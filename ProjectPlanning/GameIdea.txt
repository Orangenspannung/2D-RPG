Project Prometheus:

The game idea is a simple 2D top-down puzzle game with the appearance of a roguelike adventure.

The main Goal of each level is to reach the exit before the player gets killed.

The Main opponent in each level is a deadly fog that kills instantly. The Player needs to evade this fog and reach the exit before the exit gets blocked.

Since this game is intended to be a thoughtful game, all movable object will move only when the player moves. This includes the fog that grows with each movement.

The Main target is, therefore, reaching the exit in time and evading any time wasting activities.

The Main way to achieve that this target can't be achieved easily is to throw obstacles in the way of the player.

The goal of these obstacles is to force the player to not simply try to outrun the fog for the exit and instead think of a different solution.

The intended obstacles for the game are walls, interactive objects, traps, and enemies.

Just like the fog, traps and enemies kill instantly both the player and themselves.

The Game layout will be that of a grid, object placement and player movement will be adjusted to the grid.
